# 🧭 CSS Float Property Demo

This mini project demonstrates the use of the `float` property in CSS using an HTML page. It shows how images align differently with text when `float` is set to `none`, `left`, and `right`.


## 💡 What You'll Learn

- `float: none` — Image stays in line, text flows below.
- `float: left` — Image floats to the left, and text wraps on the right.
- `float: right` — Image floats to the right, and text wraps on the left.

## 🖼️ Preview Sections

- ✅ **Float None**
- ✅ **Float Left**
- ✅ **Float Right**

Each section has an image and a paragraph to show the effect clearly.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure the image path is correct (`/assets/images.png`).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the float effects in action.
